%ACHA_SPARSITYANALYSIS Code to reproduce sparsity analysis
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%       This code can be used to reproduce the sparsity analysis in the paper:
%   E. Zea, M. Laudato, J. Andén, "A continuous boostlet transform for acoustic waves 
%   in space-time", arXiv:2403.11362, March 2024. 
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% EXAMPLE OF USAGE: 
%   To reproduce the sparsity analysis in Figure 6 of the paper, run the command: 
%
%       > ACHA_SparsityAnalysis;
%
%   The output produces a figure (Figure 1) corresponding to Figure 6 in the paper. 
%   A table including the l1-norm of the 20.0000 largest coefficients, corresponding 
%   to Table I in the manuscript, is output in the Command Window.

% DEPENDENCIES
%       Folders:    'Datasets'          measured acoustic fields in three rooms [1]
%                   'Toolboxes'         curvelets, wave atoms, and shearlets 
% 
%   The curvelet toolbox (CurveLab-2.1.3) is taken from [2], the wave atoms toolbox 
%   (WaveAtom-1.1.1) from [3], and the shearlet toolbox (FFST) from [4].
